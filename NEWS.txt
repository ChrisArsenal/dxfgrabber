Version 0.7.3 - 2014-05-..

  * NEW: ``options = {"assure_3d_coords": True}``, guarantees (x, y, z) tuples for ALL coordinates, this option is by default
    ``False``
  * NEW: extended TrueColor() class, see docs
  * NEW: dxfgrabber.aci_to_true_color(index) returns the DXF default true color value for AutoCAD Color Index *index*
    as TrueColor()
  * CHANGE: LWPolyline again: LWPolyline.points list of (x, y) or (x, y, z) depends on "assure_3d_coords",
    LWPolyline.width list of (start-width, end-width), .bulge list of floats, removed LWPolyline.get_rstrip_points() and
    added .const_width attribute (if != 0, ignore .width list).

  * NEW: grabs SAB data of BODY, 3DSOLID, ... entities for DXF version AC1027 (R2013) and later

    in prior DXF versions this attributes are set to None.
